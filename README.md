# Chess Game Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze a dataset of chess games to uncover insights and patterns within the data. The analysis focuses on understanding the number of games, the dependency of results on various factors, and visualizing key trends.

## Table of Contents
1. [Number of Games](#1-number-of-games)
    - 1.1 [Number of Games Online vs Number of Games Offline](#11-number-of-games-online-vs-number-of-games-offline)
2. [Dependency of Result](#2-dependency-of-result)
    - 2.1 [Result vs Colors](#21-result-vs-colors)
    - 2.2 [Result vs ELO](#22-result-vs-elo)

## 1. Number of Games
### 1.1 Number of Games Online vs Number of Games Offline
In this section, we analyze the total number of games and categorize them based on whether they were played online or offline. This analysis helps in understanding the distribution and popularity of online versus offline chess games.

## 2. Dependency of Result
### 2.1 Result vs Colors
This section explores the relationship between the game results (win, loss, draw) and the colors (white, black) played by the participants. The goal is to determine if there is a significant advantage or trend associated with playing as white or black.

### 2.2 Result vs ELO
Here, we examine the dependency of game results on the ELO ratings of the players. The ELO rating system measures the relative skill levels of players, and this analysis aims to identify how the rating differences influence the outcomes of the games.
